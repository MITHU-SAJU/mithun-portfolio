# [Responsive portfolio website](yassine-rd.github.io/portfolio-website)

## Abstract

When it comes to proving yourself professionally, documentation that provides proof of your accomplishments or samples of your work is crucial. Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in an interview — they allow you to ***show*** and not just ***tell***.
